# The Simplex method_in_Java
Code developed for the Linear Programming course.
The Simplex method is an iterative process that allows improving the solution of the objective function at each step. The process ends when it is not possible to continue improving this value, that is, when the optimal solution is obtained (the largest or smallest possible value, according to the case, so that all constraints are satisfied).
